# Least Squares Approximation

This repository contains an implementation of the Least Squares Approximation method. This mathematical technique is often used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize model parameters and reduce overfitting during the training process.

## Project Overview

The Least Squares Approximation method minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values. This makes it a useful tool for training models where the goal is to find the best fit that will predict future observations.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the main script.
